# 🎨  Art Gallery

Welcome to my **Art Gallery Project**, a digital platform crafted to celebrate the richness of artistic expression across cultures and centuries. This web application allows users to explore, engage with, and reflect on artworks from around the world—ranging from timeless sculptures and classic paintings to powerful photographs and historical literary works.

💡 How It All Started
The idea for this project was born out of a simple, yet powerful question:
“What if anyone, anywhere, could experience the beauty of global art without needing to visit a museum?”

As someone passionate about both technology and the arts, I noticed a gap in how historical and cultural artworks were being shared online. Many incredible pieces—especially those preserved in archives and CSV-formatted databases—remain hidden from the public eye due to accessibility issues or technical limitations.

So I set out to change that.

Making It Possible
Research & Data Exploration: I began by sourcing open-access datasets of global art collections. These came in various CSV formats, often scattered and inconsistently structured.

Data Engineering: I created a pipeline to clean, standardize, and import this data into a MySQL database, using a structured SQL dashboard for administration.

Web Development: With a vision for user accessibility and interaction, I designed and developed a full-stack application that allows users to not just view artworks, but discuss, review, and connect over shared interests.

User Experience: Inspired by real-world galleries, I designed the UI to be intuitive and inviting—encouraging discovery while staying true to the artistic essence.

This project blends storytelling, technology, and human curiosity into one cohesive platform.
